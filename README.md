<h1><strong>Femisphere: A Comprehensive Platform for Women</strong><br></h1>
<p align="left">
  
  Femisphere is an innovative platform designed to empower women by providing essential tools for safety, wellness, career growth, and legal assistance. This project aims to create a centralized hub where women can access critical features like live location tracking with SOS alerts, wellness tracking, job opportunities, and legal guidance.  
  Built entirely from scratch during our first frontend development hackathon, Femisphere showcases our ability to design and develop a functional, responsive, and user-friendly application.
